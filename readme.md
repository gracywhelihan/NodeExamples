# Node Examples

This is a collection of examples for node.js and express.js.

## Running on Glitch.com

If you'd like to run these on glitch.com or heroku or another node.js-based host, you may need to change the port number to comply with whatever port the platform runs your scripts on. On glitch.com, you can use:
````
process.env.PORT || portnumber
````

in place of the port number given in these scripts. Some of them have been adjusted accordingly.
